# Data Science Portfolio
Repository containing portfolio of data science projects completed by me for academic, self learning, competition,and hobby purposes. Presented in the form of iPython Notebooks markdown files.

## Contents

- ### Machine Learning

  - [Prediction of Customer Churn at a Bank](https://github.com/kh-bilal/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/Prediction_of_customer_churn_at_a_bank): The goal of this project is to predict the probability of a customer is likely to churn using machine learning techniques.
  - [Predict Patient Outcome Using Pycaret](https://github.com/kh-bilal/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/Predict_patient_outcome_using_Pycaret): In this project, I will use ‘diabetes’ dataset and the goal is to predict patient outcome (binary 1 or 0) .
  - [Predicting Boston Housing Prices](https://github.com/kh-bilal/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Prediction_Boston_Housing_Prices): A model to predict the value of a given house in the Boston real estate market using various statistical analysis tools. Identified the best price that a client can sell their house utilizing machine learning.
  - [Prediction of Electricity Consumption (KWH)](https://github.com/kh-bilal/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/Prediction_Electric_Consumption): In this project, We will predict customers' electricity consumption using supervised machine learning techniques.
  - [Natural Language Processing (NLP): Classification of articles based on the topical area](https://github.com/kh-bilal/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Classification_articles_based_the_topical_area
): In this project, the aim is to predict the likelihood that a BBC Sport document belongs to a certain topic area.
  - [NLP: SMS Spam Classifier](https://github.com/kh-bilal/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/SMS_Spam_Classifier): In this project, I seek to create such a spam detection system, but on sms messages. I will use a few different models and compare their performance.
  - [Airbnb: Predicting User's 1st Booking Destination](https://github.com/kh-bilal/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Predicting_users_1st_Booking_Destination): Analyzing a dataset containing data on various hosts',testing out several different supervised learning algorithms to build a model that accurately predicts the user's 1st Booking Destination.
  - [Deep Learning: Images Classification System using CNN](https://github.com/kh-bilal/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/Images_classification_system):  In this project, I Developed an images classification system based on the Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNN).

   Tools: Scikit-learn, PyCaret, Keras, Tensorflow, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib.

- ### Web Scraping Projects  
  - [Build a Scrape App that tracks Amazon Prices](https://github.com/kh-bilal/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/Web_Scraping_Projects/web_scraping_from_Amazon): A fast and simple way to scrape Amazon Website.
  - [Web scraping from Remax](https://github.com/kh-bilal/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/Web_Scraping_Projects/Web_scraping_from_Remax): In this project: I Scraped all the search results from one of the main real estate websites in Montreal (where I live) and build a database with all the listings found.
  
  
- ### Micro Projects: 

I also dabble in all other kinds of technology. If you liked what you saw, want to have a chat with me about the portfolio, work opportunities, or collaboration, shoot an email at khomri.bilal@gmail.com
