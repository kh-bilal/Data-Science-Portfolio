# Data Science Portfolio
Repository containing portfolio of data science projects completed by me for academic, self learning, competition,and hobby purposes. Presented in the form of iPython Notebooks markdown files.

## Contents

- ### Machine Learning

  - [Airbnb (Paris) price prediction with models](https://github.com/kh-bilal/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Airbnb_price_prediction/Airbnb_Paris_price_prediction.ipynb): Analyzing a dataset containing data on various hosts',Testing out several different supervised learning algorithms to build a model that accurately predicts the  airbnb rent price in Paris.
  - [Automated Anomaly Detection Using PyCaret](https://github.com/sajal2692/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Anomaly_Detection/Automated_Anomaly_Detection.ipynb): In this project, PyCaretâ€™s anomaly detection module is used for identifying abnormal credit card transactions by employees of the Department of Education in the State of Delaware, US.
  - [Prediction of customer churn at a bank](https://github.com/kh-bilal/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/prediction_customer_churn_bank/prediction-of-customer-churn-at-a-bank.ipynb): The goal of this project is to predict the probability of a customer is likely to churn using machine learning techniques.
  - [Predicting Boston Housing Prices](https://github.com/kh-bilal/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/boston_housing/boston_housing.ipynb): A model to predict the value of a given house in the Boston real estate market using various statistical analysis tools. Identified the best price that a client can sell their house utilizing machine learning.
- [Deep Learning: Images classification system using CNN](https://github.com/kh-bilal/data-science-portfolio/blob/master/Images_classification_system/classification-system-using-CNN.ipynb):  In this project, I Developed an images classification system based on the Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNN).
