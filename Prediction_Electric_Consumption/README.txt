## Overview
In this project, we will analyze and visualize the data by identifying the features' importance with the strongest statistical associations to residential electricity usage (KWH), then we will apply the data processing and feature selection if necessary. At the end, we will predict customers' electricity consumption using supervised machine learning techniques.
