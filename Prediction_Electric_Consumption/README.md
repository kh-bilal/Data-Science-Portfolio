## Overview
In this project, we will use ‘diabetes’ dataset and the goal is to predict patient outcome (binary 1 or 0) based on several factors such as Blood Pressure, Insulin Level, Age etc. 
[Predict patient outcome: Comprehnsive data exploration, Evaluation and Comparison between several machine learning models.](https://github.com/kh-bilal/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Predict_patient_outcome_using_Pycaret/Predict%20patient%20outcome%20using%20Pycaret.ipynb)

The dataset is available on PyCaret’s github repository. Easiest way to import dataset directly from repository is by using get_data function from pycaret.datasets modules.
